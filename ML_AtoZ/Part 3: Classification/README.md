# Part 3: Classification

This folder will contain all regression topics and associated projects:


**Classification Models**

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:

1. Logistic Regression

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. Kernel SVM

5. Naive Bayes

6. Decision Tree Classification

7. Random Forest Classification



**How do we determing which model is the best?**
- CAP Curve = Cumulative Accuracy Profile Curve
- the gain chart
- the ideal line: if you had the crystal ball = perfect model
- ROC Receiver Operating Charateristics != CAP
- perfect model vs good model vs random model

**Prediction goal:** 
- 90% < X < 100% too good - over fitting/ forward looking variables
- 80% < X < 90% very good - but check for overfiting
- 70% < X < 80% good -> goal
- 60% < X < 70% poor- not recommneded
- x < 60% very poor - danger zone
